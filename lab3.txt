Tried to do this. Couldn't figure it out. 


1. Each of the ammonite specimens in Part I of Lab 2 belongs to one of these three species. Based on 1) the morphologic information on these three species in the Paleobiology Database and 2) the morphologic information from Lab 2, can you tell which specimens belong to which species? Explain your reasoning.
a) Involute vs evolute, W/D dimensions
2. Look up Xenoceltites variocostatus in the Paleobiology Database. Find the first person (journal paper/reference) to name this species. (Hint: Both the first and second author's last names start with "B"). What is the name of the article?
a) Smithian (Early Triassic) Ammonoid Faunas from Northwestern Guangxi (South China): Taxonomy and Biochronology
3. Do a google scholar search for this article. Open it and scroll down to the "Plates" subsection. You should see various pictures of different ammonites towards the very end of the article. Find the pictures of Xenoceltites variocostatus. Based on the features in these pictures, can you identify which specimens in Part I of Lab 2 belong to this species?
a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25
