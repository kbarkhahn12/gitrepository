Has the Earth’s sixth mass extinction already arrived? (2011)

> 10/10

## Article Summary

This paper focuses on whether or not we have entered into the sixth mass extinction on Earth. Mass extinctions are characterized as a loss of more than three quarters of Earth’s species in a geologically short interval. The paper begins with the countless data disparities and problems occurred with the fossil record in measuring magnitude and rates of extinctions. These problems range from underestimating species numbers, to which species are best preserved in the fossil record, and how current species have not been adequately recorded. The studies done show that although we have not fully entered a mass extinction event, we are experiencing drops in biodiversity similar to times just a few hundred years before other mass extinction events. If threatened or endangered species were to be lost within a few hundred years, we would then label the event as a mass extinction. 

## Things you liked about the paper

I like the idea of the paper, and I agree that this is a topic that needs to be further studied. What I liked most was the analysis of the problems that have arisen with measuring biodiversity today. As geologists, we are so focused on what happened in the past that it is easy to not make the connections to what is happening now in terms of biodiversity. In particular, I liked the statement that the fossil record shows that species richness and evenness taken as “normal” today are actually low when compared to pre-anthropogenic conditions. It really puts our entire mindset of “normal” into question. 

## Things you did not like about the paper

I did not like how the paper started. The very first sentence is that 99% of species on Earth have gone extinct over the last 3.5 billon years. This is not surprising. 3.5 billion years is a really long time. Not to mention all the problems and estimations that would need to be made to achieve that statistic. Personally, I found the extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY) to be confusing. There also seems to be many assumptions and estimations made in order to carry out one of these comparisons. The accuracy and reliability of this method is questionable, but I am also not sure of another method that could be used in this kind of study. 

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Table one describes the big five mass extinction events and their proposed causes. Many of the proposed causes show just how little we as humans can control mass extinctions. Tectonics, bolide impacts, and volcanism are uncontrolled events that can all seriously affect life on Earth. On the other hand, and what is also mentioned in the paper, the factors that we can “control” – ie climate change, glacial melting, ect. – it may already be too late to relieve these pressures. 

Table two describes the methods of comparing present and past extinctions with their representative studies. I think this was good to include in the paper, but it does not provide enough information for someone who is unfamiliar with metrics and short fallings of each of these methods to really gage how useful the studies are. I would have appreciated more detail, although at least the information is there and references are citied if further research was necessary. 

Figure one shows the relationship between extinction rates and the time interval over which the rates were calculated for mammals. This isn’t a very helpful figure. Showing information on only mammals does not show how overall biodiversity is being affected. I also think that the figure is not very clear, and takes a long time to figure out what it is trying to convey. I think the information could have been presented in a better fashion, and with more than just mammals. 

Figure two shows extinction magnitudes of IUCN assessed taxa in comparison to the 75% mass extinction benchmark. It clearly shows that species today have not yet reached the level of mass extinction, and it is easy to see just how large that difference is to species that were lost during mass extinctions. 

Figure three shows extinction rate versus extinction magnitude. It is a bit more confusing than figure two, even though the overall message seems to be the same – that we have not yet reached a loss of 75% of species. It is always good to show data in different forms in order to see other variables and gain new insight, but I did not feel that this particular figure was needed because figure two summed everything up quite well.
