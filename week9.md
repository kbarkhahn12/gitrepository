## Article Summary

<strike>This authors’</strike> The authors of this article developed a system to categorize the ecological changes that come with mass extinctions, in order to analyze paleoecological effects of the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions. Their system ranges from <strike>a</strike> first level changes (the appearance/disappearance of an ecosystem) to fourth level changes (community level changes). The Late Ordovician mass extinction was categorized with third and fourth level changes due to organisms that were strongly affected by the mass extinction but were able to <strike>diversify</strike> recover quickly after the extinction. These organisms include: metazoan reef communities, graptolites, pelagic conodonts, nautiloid cephalopods, and brachiopods. The Late Devonian mass extinction was categorized with second, third and fourth level changes. This is due to the many organisms that were severely affected by the extinction and were unable to recover. These organisms include: tabulate corals, stromatoporoid sponges, cricoconarids, placoderm fish, and many species of brachiopods. In addition, many of the organisms who survived were forced to adapt to their new environment, leading to species origination. The authors found that although the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions were similar taxonomically, the Late Devonian extinction had a more lasting ecological effect and produced greater changes in ecosystems. This is further supported by the Paleozoic time-environment diagram, showing that Paleozoic fauna briefly invaded shallow waters during the Late Devonian, but not the Late Ordovician. 

## Things you liked about the paper

I liked the overall concept of the paper, that when mass extinctions are examined, usually only taxonomy is considered as a form of measurement. From a geologic perspective, I had not previously considered the paleoecologic changes associated with mass extinction, or the effect that the extinction of one dominate taxa has on its environment relating to the extinction of other species in the same environment. It helped to create more of a background as to why the extinctions are so <strike>differently</strike> different in a paleoecologic sense verses a taxonomic sense. I thought that the Paleozoic time-environment diagram was extremely useful in supporting the authors’ theory, and also looking at the problem in a more quantitative way, rather than qualitative. 

## Things you did not like about the paper

I think having a more quantitative method to classifying the paleoecological levels of mass extinctions would have provided a more concrete analysis of the data. Other researchers could look at the same data and possibly come up with different results. Even expanding the number of paleoecological levels could prove to cause a difference in the results. I liked the addition of dominate taxa and keystone species, but I think there could have been more information added, or an entire section devoted to the topic. It would have been a good way to imply a possible causation or occurrence pertaining to the differences in paleoenvironments between mass extinctions. 

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Table 1 gave the definitions of each Paleoecological level and the characteristics and signals associated with each. It helps to convey the differences in the levels in a clear way, rather than the complete discussion of them in the paper. To improve it, I think including a column of examples of each level could help solidify their descriptions. 

Figure 1 is the Paleozoic time-environment diagram showing the environmental and temporal distributions of Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern faunas. The x axis represents deep to shallow waters, and the y axis shows the time period. Denoted are both the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions. What is important to note is at the Late Devonian the Paleozoic fauna reinvaded shallow waters and drove out many Modern fauna. This variation does not appear in the Late Ordovician, showing that the Late Devonian experienced a more lasting ecological effect that produced greater changes in ecosystems.
