## Article Summary

The authors of this article made predictions on how biodiversity will change by the year 2100. They looked at how biodiversity is effected, and how they differ across biomes of the world. They used a ranking system to produce data, upon which they calculated three different results: a no interactions result in which the main drivers of biodiversity do not change, an antagonistic interactions result in which total biodiversity change is effected only by the largest driver of change, and a synergistic interactions result in which all major drivers of change are calculated and complied together. Their study only considered terrestrial and freshwater organisms, excluding all marine systems. They found that land use change is the largest driver of biodiversity change for each biome, which is almost always a human controlled change. They also found that grasslands and Mediterranean ecosystems will have experienced the largest loss of biodiversity due to their higher sensitivity to all drivers of biodiversity change. The authors also note the uncertainties in their results, and that there are nonlinearities among many biodiversity drivers. 

## Things you liked about the paper

The authors did a good job of discussing the different drivers of biodiversity changes and how they believed they would affect each biome. It helped create an understanding of their ranking system for expected biodiversity changes. Figure three was especially helpful in visualizing the biodiversity changes that could possibly occur by 2100. It was easy to see how these changes differ across the globe, and also how they differ for each of their three scenarios. The inclusion of how humans are also drivers of biodiversity shows that it is not just climate change that is affecting biodiversity. Not only are they the drivers of land use, but they also help transport invasive species to other areas. Including the concept of biotic introductions and how islands tend to have low diversity and therefore are prone to biotic invasions, shows just how easily biodiversity can be changed. 

## Things you did not like about the paper

One thing I did not like about the paper was the method of data evaluation, mainly the ranking that was assigned each biodiversity driver for the individual biomes. The data that the entire study is based on is qualitative, with little to back up the reasoning. `I felt similarly` The authors’ quote sources upon which they generated their rankings, but even when the sources are put together they are subjective. Although I agree with the arguments for their rankings, for this type of study to be done I think there needs to be more quantitative data present to rank each of the biodiversity drivers. The statistics that were performed on their data was also not well described in the paper. The majority of how they quantitatively came to their results was described in the descriptions of their tables and graphs. In addition, I did not agree with the three scenarios that were presented as possible biodiversity changes by 2100. The first option rejects the biodiversity drivers completely, and the second only takes into account the driver with the potential to cause the largest change. Neither of these options seem feasible. `I think they are just trying to constrain the end-member cases, this is common in science where there is a spectrum of possibilities and you don't know where thing will fall, so you look at the ends.` Furthermore, the authors are unable to predict if the biodiversity driver with the highest impact for a biome will change by the year 2100. Their results for the third option, synergistic interactions, might be closest to what reality might yield, but it there are too many unknowns to predict this far into the future. 

## Evaluate the graphs and figures

Table 1 shows the expected changes of the five major drivers of biodiversity change with a numeric rating for the year 2100. For example, land use in the Artic is not expected to have much, if any, change by 2100, and so has a ranking of 1.0. The table displays their data clearly and concisely. I think it would help to highlight the extremes of both ends of the scale, the ones and fives, to show the contrasts between variables and biomes. 

Table 2 shows the same variables as table 1, but numerically ranks how one factor would impact each biome if it were to be altered. Again, the data is clear and concise, but highlighting the smallest and largest factors would have improved the table. 

Figure 1 is a graph of the relative effect of each driver of biodiversity. Overall, land use is the largest driver and atmospheric CO2 the smallest. This was a good way to show the results of table 2 in a different form. 

Figure 2 shows multiple small graphs of each biome, and the relative biodiversity change for each driver. This time they added streams and lakes into the biome list. The figure is effectively a representation of the data that was presented in table 1. It is a good visual representation, but the graphs are small and difficult to collect data off of, therefore giving the impression that they are not important to the paper. 

Tables 3 and 4 show the same variables as tables 1 and 2, but with lakes and streams as the biomes. This data could have been condensed into the previous tables, even though these biomes were talked about later in the paper. Splitting up tables with the same information does not really make sense. 

Figure 3 shows the three scenarios of expected change in biodiversity: no interactions, antagonistic interactions, and synergistic interactions. This figure does a good job of showing the uncertainties that are held with the authors’ data and predictions.
