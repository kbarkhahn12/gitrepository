How good was the fossil record? Clues from the Californian Pleistocene 
By: James W. Valentine (1989)

> 10/10

## Article Summary
The author wanted to conclude if the fossil record in the Californian Province during the Pleistocene has been preserved well and if the fossils were a good representation of the organisms that lived there, specifically in marine benthic communities. These were chosen because about 87% of species are still represented in the living population. The author set various requirements for the species to include in the study, including living within the province at shelf depths (about 180 m or less), and also included species at different islands around the province that also lived at shelf depths. Species that are considered to be ephemeral in the region were not included in the study. A total of 747 molluscan species (113 families) were used, which is just higher than the number of species currently present. The author found that there is a fairly complete record of molluscan fossils, and that of these many are of species in today’s population. The author notes that it is possible that deep water records may be of better use to the study, but has not been studied as thoroughly as shallow water records. In addition, small mollusks are also not as comprehensively studied, and could account for some bias in the study. 

## Things you liked about the paper
The author explained very well how he determined which species to include in his study. His reasoning was clearly laid out and detailed about how he made the decision to either include or exclude a certain species. I think this allowed the study to be more accurate than if those species were included. I also liked that the author included the biases that may have affected the outcome of the study, for example, preservation bias, which could significantly change the results of the study.  I think it was a good idea that the author restricted the area of the study to only the Californian Province and only from the Pleistocene until present. This significantly cuts down on the amount of data, as well as somewhat controls the depositional environment that caused these specimens to be preserved. If the area was significantly expanded, there would be many other variables that could contribute to changing of preservation rates of the mollusks. 

## Things you did not like about the paper
I thought that there was a lack of methodology explained on how the author came to his results. There is a plethora of information on how he chose which species to include, but very little on his process of coming to the conclusion that the fossil record is in fact fairly complete. The author transitions from “these are the species we looked at”, to “there is a surprisingly complete record”. The graphs and figures included in the article also do not include any sort of time line that could be associated with each species. The author insists that his conclusion is correct, with no evidence for support. Instead, he includes biases that could significantly alter his conclusions, which shows that he realizes that there could be errors, but he is also not looking into these factors (at least not at this time). 

> I'm a little puzled by this. The result was rather straight-forward, he presents a table of the percentages shared between the fossil record and the living assemblage.
      
## Evaluate the graphs and figures 
Figure one is a map of the principal sites that were referenced in the article. The figure also does a nice job of indicating where the Californian Province is located as well as the separate islands that were mentioned. 

Table one is a summary of the living pool of molluscan species from the Californian Province. It is separated into three categories: living, known fossil, and percent of known fossil. The table clearly displays the amount of similarities between known fossils and living molluscan families, genera, and species.

The appendix also includes the various families found on the Californian Province, and again gives the living species, known species fossils, living genera, and known genera fossils. I thought this was a good table to include in the article, and allows for further reading on these different species if wanted. I also thought it was good to add it in the appendix rather than taking up almost a full page of the article. I have never seen this done in this way before.
